# SiameseCNN
The goal of this project is to solve the task of facial recognition using Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks. This project inspired by the paper [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf). The data used for this project is the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/index.html). The report with description of the results attached in the Deep Learning - Assignment 2.pdf file ([link](https://github.com/MaorSagi/SiameseCNN/blob/main/Deep%20Learning%20-%20Assignment%202.pdf)).
